New day and new update to the neovim config. 

Switched side on the explorer in neovim and added Astro as a language to nvim-treesitter ðŸ™ƒ I still have some issues getting error highlighting.. I have to look into it a bit more. But with that said I get more and more familiar with the structure and the configs of neovim.

I also took the time and updated the sorting, or rather added storing on the published posts on the `/blog` view.
