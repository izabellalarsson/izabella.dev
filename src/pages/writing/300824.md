I am back and have done a few updates to the site. It is a good thing that I did this site the way I did - I made it so easy that I was able to get back to it *just like that*. This is not a compex site and the effort for updating is really low, which might just save me when I don't feel like updating. 

So thoughts about the future. I started with the goal to learn Vim in the process of building this - I think that was the point where I shoot my self in the foot. I don't have the time to sit with Vim right now and it is 100% okey for me not to. Focus should be on things that I think is fun. 

I have updated the fonts, the color scheme and overall touch and feel. Added a [setup](https://izabella.dev/setup/) page just to have somewhere where I keep that kind of info - which I lacked now when I started a new job and had to setup a new computer. I will also really try to find a solution for my dotenv files, upload them to github and keep that inforformation around here somewhere. Just to make it easier. 

Next step is to acually add my work experiance to the site and also fix all the little things that I want to add.
