When switching workplace there are a few things that is a must to bring with me, from one computer to another. For every time I try to make the transition smoother, one for the sake to be up and running fast and two for my sanity. 

During my resent move I found this code snippet for listing all the Visual Studio Code extensions: 

```
$ code --list-extensions | xargs -L 1 echo code --install-extension
```

This lists all the extentions installed in Visual Studio Code and adds the `code --install-extension` prefix to the name. NEAT!
