As I am mentioning on the landing page I have a urge to broden my skillset as a software developer and the cloud part have felt intreeging ever since my first look. Don't get me wrong, I still feel passoined about the frontend stuffs and I am long from fully learned on that part, but I also want to keep testing and challange myself to try new things.

So this fall I have decided to invest some time to do that - building my backend and cloud skills, starting with AWS, Infrastructure as code, and eventdriven architechture. Alongside I will try to keep this blog more alive and make small little updates alongside.

Here is a link to the repo I will be working in: https://github.com/izabellalarsson/cloud-journey
