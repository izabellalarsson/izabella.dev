I will update here about my toughts and my process of building my site.

All of the content written up to this point is from a guide I followed for learning the basics about Astro, [building your first Astro blog](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/)

So lets get started with a few things on what I will start with:

- [ ] Update the color theme on the site
- [ ] Show a preview of the post on the `/blog` page
- [ ] Clean up unwanted content from the Astro guide

Apart from just updating the site and learn things during that time I will try to force myself to use vim ([neovim](https://neovim.io/)) while doing so. Just to get more experiance with it and maybe start using it professionally in the future.

And and working on my english!

But wwill start with zero expectation and see what will come out of it.
